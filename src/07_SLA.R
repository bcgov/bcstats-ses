# Quick comment: Brett is on vacation right now (2024-12-02) and I'm hoping he has some background information on this dataset (for example, what columns do we care about, etc.). I'm forging ahead in the meantime using my intuition.

SLA_file = use_network_path("data/StatsCanLFS/SLA2016_FinalClassification.xlsx")
SLA = readxl::read_excel(SLA_file)

# only BC - this is weird but I think it's correct - since when was BC the 59th province?
SLA = SLA |>
  filter(PR == "59") |>
  select(-PR)

# Clean the names as per previous work
SLA = SLA |> 
  rename(CSDName = CSDname, CSDType = CSDtype) |>
  janitor::clean_names(case = "screaming_snake")

# The most granular column is CSD. Note that they all begin with '59'.
SLA |>
  pull(CSD) |>
  substr(1,2) |>
  unique()

# So let's dump that 59 nonsense
SLA$CSD = substr(SLA$CSD, 3, nchar(SLA$CSD))

# convert everything to characters. This is because it appears that other files, such as the TMF, don't do integers (which would be my preference, for the record).
SLA = SLA |>
 mutate(across(everything(), as.character))

# if the SLA NAME is null the code should be too, no?
SLA = SLA |>
  mutate(SLA_CODE = case_when(is.na(SLA_NAME) ~ NA_character_, T ~ SLA_CODE))

# there is some wackiness involving SLA_CODE and CMACASLA_CODE. For example: there are zero rows here, indicating that these columns are redundant.
SLA |> na.omit() |> filter(SLA_CODE != CMACASLA_CODE)

# however, this indicates that CMACASLA_CODE is more granular than SLA_CODE. Why?????????????? In any case, we'll just keep all the columns and let the benighted data scientist have to sort this out
SLA |> filter(is.na(SLA_CODE)) |> select(1:3)

# Another Issue: using SLA makes for a bad join key because there are duplicate rows. For example:
SLA |> count(SLA_CODE)

# Joining to other tables in this project is not perfectly straightforward. As discussed, you want to join on CSD. Here's an example:

# SLA |> inner_join(TMF, by=join_by(CSD == CDCSD_2021))
# A tibble: 133,958 Ã— 76


# lookin' good
