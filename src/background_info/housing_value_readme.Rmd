This project is created to analyze the housing assessed value dataset. 
The output of this project will be used for the SES project.

## SQL Query Overview

This repository contains two primary SQL queries that analyze housing assessed values in relation to income data:


### 01 House Value Income DA.sql


This query analyzes residential property values at the Dissemination Area (DA) level. It:

1. Cleans postal codes in BCA address data
2. Links property values with geographic identifiers (DA)
3. Filters for only residential properties (single family and strata) with values over $50,000
4. Calculates average property statistics by DA including:
   - Property counts
   - Average improvement values
   - Average land values
   - Average total property values
   - Minimum and maximum property values
5. Determines median property values using PERCENTILE_CONT
6. Joins with 2021 median income data
7. Produces a final dataset showing property value metrics alongside average median income

This query follows also includes:

1. More comprehensive code comments explaining each step
2. Updated reference to the 2024 geographic classification system
3. Systematic organization of CTEs (Common Table Expressions) with clear purpose for each:
   - Address standardization
   - Property-location linkage
   - Average value calculations
   - Median value calculations
   - Income data integration
4. Identical output format but with improved query readability and documentation

This query is designed to support the SES (Socioeconomic Status) Index project by providing property value metrics that can be correlated with income data at the DA level.

## R Script Implementation

### 01_house_value_income_da.R

This R script performs the same analysis as the SQL queries but using R's tidyverse ecosystem. The script:

1. **Configuration Management**:
   - Uses the `config` package to load database connection parameters and table names
   - Supports different environments through configuration profiles

2. **Data Sources**:
   - Connects to SQL Server database using parameters from config.yml
   - Access the following database tables:
     - `FCT_bca_folio_addresses_202502`: Contains property addresses with postal codes
     - `FCT_bca_folio_gnrl_property_values_2023`: Contains property valuation data
     - `FCT_GCS_202309`: Geographic Correspondence System table that links postal codes to dissemination areas
     - `FCT_FIN_MEDINCOME_6DIG_PC`: Contains income data by postal code

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Cleans and standardizes postal codes
   - Filters for residential properties with values over $50,000
   - Links properties to geographic identifiers (DA)
   - Uses dbplyr to perform SQL operations in R syntax
   - Calculates property statistics at the DA level:
     - Count of properties
     - Average improvement values
     - Average land values
     - Average and median total property values
     - Minimum and maximum property values
   - Joins with 2021 median income data by DA

4. **Output**:
   - Produces a CSV file with timestamp in the filename
   - Contains all property value metrics alongside average median income by DA
   - File is saved in the path specified in the configuration file
   - Final dataset includes DA, jurisdiction, property counts, value metrics, and income data

The R implementation offers several advantages:
- More maintainable code through tidyverse's consistent syntax
- Configuration management for different environments
- Improved data pipeline traceability
- Direct integration with R-based statistical analysis and visualization tools
- Automatic timestamping of output files

Both the SQL and R implementations produce equivalent datasets that support the SES Index project by providing property value metrics correlated with income data at the DA level.
