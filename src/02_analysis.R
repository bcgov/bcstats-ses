# 1. BC Translation_Master_File
# TMF
# TMF %>% glimpse()
# TMF is a dataframe in a postal code level. 
# ACTIVE field shows which postal code region is still available.

# what we want is a DA level dataframe, but DA is not aligned with other regional variable very well, we may need to break the DA into two parts and join to regions. We could use population or postal code as weights. 
# The da 2021 is in short form: for example, 0225 as string
# DA id  in long form
# 59 09 0103
# PR-CD-DA code
# Province 59: British Columbia
# CD 09: Fraser Valley
# DA 0103
# ACTIVE == "Y" is critical, otherwise, DA will not match to its CSD since the DA is in short form. 

TMF_DA_LEVEL  <-  TMF %>% 
  filter(ACTIVE == "Y") %>% 
  count(DA_NUM, CD_2021, CSD_2021, DA_2021, MUN_NAME_2021)  


# 6967



# It seems not every DA has one to one matching to CHSA regions such as CHSA. So to join to other tables with other regions, we will need TO separate the DA into different regions using population as weights.  
# 


TMF_DA_CHSA_LEVEL  <-  TMF %>% 
  filter(ACTIVE == "Y") %>% 
  count(DA_NUM, CD_2021, CSD_2021, DA_2021, MUN_NAME_2021, CHSA)

# The number of DA in Census2021 (7848) is larger than the number of DA in TMF (6967)

# DA id is in long form
# 59 09 0103
# PR-CD-DA code
# Province 59: British Columbia
# CD 09: Fraser Valley
# DA 0103

# `Region Name` actually is the DA number 59150004
# which does not include CSD information, CSD looks like 5915055, 5915 is the CD, so DA and CSD should be using together. 
# test if there are different DA
